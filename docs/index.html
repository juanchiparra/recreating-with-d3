    <section class="introduction">
      <p>Each week I'll recreate a data visualization that has caught my attention from a media outlet. Regardless of how it was visualized, I will try to recreate it using D3.js.</p>
      <p>I'll try to achieve the same look and feel of the visualization, and as for the data, there might be some inaccuracy, it will depend on the accessibility of the data.</p>
      <p><b>Why do I do it?</b> It's a challenge that will give me obstacles and opportunities to learn, experiment, and share my knowledge with the data visualization community.</p>
      <p>I know that I'll enjoy it and that I'll become more and more comfortable with using D3.js.</p>
